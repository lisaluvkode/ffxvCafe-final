    <section class="about">
      <p>Do you love Final Fantasy games? Ever wish you could spend time in one of its magical realms? Then visiting Final Fantasy Cafe in Altissia, City Upon the Water is a no-brainer. Wouldn’t it be incredible to eat dishes you’ve only ever seen in games, or find some cool items made three-dimensional from the screen? Themed spaces allow you to suspend reality for a moment and play make-believe. </p>
      <p>Enjoy appetizers, entrees, desserts and more brought to you straight from the world of Eos! Many different food and recipes are inspired by Final Fantasy XV video game. It is an important part of gameplay to survive. Cooking has the same rewards as in real life: It’s social. Preparing meals and have conversation with our customers is our priority to make a smile on their face. The history and culture of the game world are deepened through its cuisine. Just like in real life, the primary goal for visiting a new city in Final Fantasy XV is to see what the restaurants have to offer. And this was absolutely the goal. "In the game, food is part of the expression of each city’s culture," says Hasegawa. "However, what was important was not to focus on particular cultures, but to give the impression of traveling long distances by showing how culinary cultures change by region." So get cooking, because you're going to need a good dinner and a solid night's sleep for tomorrow. It's a big day! </p>
